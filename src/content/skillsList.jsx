Summary for Determining the Total Hit Points:\n    1. Start with a base hit point total equal to Constitution divided by 10 rounded up.\n    2.

        type: "Special",
        description: `
            This is the skill of transmitting and receiving power between two willing individuals over any distance, provided that contact can be made. The transmitter of the power must be able to see the receiver or know his exact location (direction and distance, or a specific place). The receiver must know exactly when the spell is coming. For example, if a Cleric was at a certain altar at a certain time (midnight of full moon) ready to receive a spell, then another spell user (or deity) could use Channeling to send him a spell (if he knew where the altar was and the correct time). In some cases, it will occur when a Cleric is on a vital mission and his god decides to aid him. It is permissible, however, for characters to Channel to each other.\n\nIt is important to note that the spells a "Channeling" spell user (e.g., Clerics, Animist, Healer, etc.) acquires normally through worship and the use of intrinsic power points (although the entire realm is termed "Channeling") are not subject to this rule. Similarly, the acquisition of Channeling skill will not allow others to gain a "Channeling" spell user's intrinsic spell ability. This skill applies to extraordinary channeling.\n\n**Transmitting Power Points:** Normally Channeling consists of transferring power points from one character to another. The sender expends the power points and multiplies this number of power points by his channeling skill rank bonus expressed as a percentage (e.g., a sender with a 60% Channeling skill rank bonus - skill rank 12 - and expending 20 power points actually channels only 12 = 60% x 20). Treat channeling abilities of greater than 100 as 100, and round down the resulting power points. This is the number of points sent. The receiving character multiplies the number of points sent by his Channeling skill rank bonus (again, expressed as a percentage, the result is rounded down, and channeling abilities of more than 100 are treated as 100). This result is the number of points received. These points may be used by the receiving character to cast spells as he wishes, although any unused points will be lost when next he sleeps.\n\nChanneling between characters (including NPCs) may only take place if they are concentrating on the same realm of power. In other words, a Cleric can't channel to a Magician. In the case of a Non-spell user (e.g., Fighter, Thief, Rogue, Warrior Monk, Dancer, Burglar, Barbarian, High Warrior Monk, Scholar or Trader), the character's realm of magic should be determined at 1st level. Gods are, of course, able to channel to whomever they please. Hybrids may channel to or be channeled to by the character's concentration on either of the Hybrid's realms (e.g., a Mystic can channel in either Essence or Mentalism).\n\n**Transmitting Spells:** Spells may be channeled in rare cases. If the receiver is of the proper spell realm, the sender may cast spells through him. It is not necessary for the receiver to know how to cast the spell; he is not required to do any of the work. The spell is cast, and the power points expended by the sender. The power points are subject to the same modifications for Channeling skill rank bonuses as power points sent without a spell, and sufficient power points must be received to cast the spell. The spell may not be cast if it depends on the receiving character to provide any of the power points; nor may the spell be cast by one individual while the power points required to cast the spell are channeled by someone else.\n\n**Example:** Bak is of the Mentalist realm of Magic. He has skill rank 1 in Channeling (5%) and no further bonuses. A high-level Mentalist, Moour, offers to channel through him, and Bak, in need of such help, agrees. Moour must either see Bak, make mental contact with him, or know exactly where Bak is. Bak must also know the exact time that the spell is being sent. Moour, in a crucial situation, throws "Ice Resistance" (a 3rd level spell) and puts 60 spell points into the effort. He has a 100% Channeling ability and all 60 points are sent, but Bak receives only 5% or 3 of them. This, however, is enough to power the spell and it takes effect. Had Moour possessed only a 90% Channeling ability, he would have had to expend 67 points for the spell to take effect (90% x 67 = 60 points sent, with 5% x 60 = 3 points being received). Failure to provide even one of these 67 spell points would make it impossible for the spell to work.\n\n**Burnout Due to Channeling:** Successful Channeling can be dangerous. Roll 1-100 and add the number of power points received (this die roll is open-ended). Subtract the skill rank in Channeling of the receiving character. If the result is over 100, a burnout has occurred.\n\n**Example:** Bak's brother Geen is a Cleric, with Skill Rank 14 in Channeling. In a crucial situation, he asks his god, Blag, for help and Blag responds (the GM rolls an incredible reaction for the deity) by throwing the spell "Absolution Pure" through the Cleric. This is a 20th level spell and the god sends 40 power points with the spell. All 40 are sent (Blag is a god) and Geen receives 58% of them (23). He now rolls 0-100 to determine if it affects him. He rolls a 48 (+23 for the power points received in the spell), -14 for his skill rank (note that the skill rank, not the bonus is subtracted). The total is 57 (48 + 23 = 71 - 14 = 57) and Geen does not suffer burnout.\n\nSuppose that Geen had rolled a 97 instead of a 48. Since 97 is over 95, under the "open-ended" rules, he must roll again and add. He rolls a 23 the second time for a total "roll" of 120 before modifications. Again +23 - 14, yielding a 129. Geen has suffered some form of burnout.\n\nIf burnout occurs, roll twice on the 15+ column of 15.12 Stat Gain Table, ChL&CaL, pg 30. This is the number of points that are lost from the Memory stat (the temporary, not the potential). This process is repeated for Reasoning. If this process reduces either stat to 0 or below, all experience and skills are lost. On the brighter side, the character can switch professions as he has lost all memory of his adolescence and apprenticeship (though it will take him many years to function as an adult again).\n\n**Option when using Spell Law:** If Spell Law is available and a burnout occurs, a 1-100 is made and 5x the amount that the burnout roll was above 100 is added. This total is applied to the Non-attack Spell Failure Table (Refer: 10.72 Non-Attack Section, SL, Table 10.7 Spell Failure Table). This result can be in addition to the loss of Memory and Reasoning or instead of it (at the GM's discretion).\n\nShould a burnout occur, the being channeling power to the victim must roll under his Presence on 1-100 or suffer the same result (gods would not be affected). If the sender survives, unharmed, he may (regardless of the status or will of the receiving individual) exercise absolute control over the victim's body and its remaining knowledge, skills, spells, and power points. The sender must have some method of issuing commands and instructions to the burnout victim. This control lasts 24 hours or until contact is broken.

            Spell Law makes provision for Spell Attacks Rolls with certain "elemental" spells. (These spells are specifically listed there; and have separate attack tables.) Skill may be developed separately for each such spell. Developing skill in Directed Spells is treated just as developing skill in weapons. Generally, skill may be developed only for spells that are directed against a single target (e.g., Fire Bolts but not Fire Ball or Fire Storms). A character wishing to develop skill with such a spell must be able to cast it at least once a day (either intrinsically or from an item or runes).\n\nThis rule is important for it allows certain Spell Users to specialize in particular spells in the same manner that fighters may specialize in their weapons.\n\n**Option 1:** This option allows development of Directed Spell skill for the elemental "Ball" spells. Under this Option, no +30 for "center of effect" is allowed, and the Directed Spell skill bonus is applicable to the "center of effect" target only.\n\n**Option 2:** The GM may feel that the skills of Directed Spells are in fact quite similar to each other and so fall under the precedent of similar skill treatment. Be warned, however, that this will result in spell users being better than normal in the casting of directed spells. At the very least, they will have more development points freed for the development of other skills. In order to show the difficulty of mastering the directed skill as a similar skill, the GM may decide that this Option should only be open to pure spell users and perhaps a few appropriate hybrids.

            This skill affects how much information and how many clues a character gets through observation. It may be used to notice the right things, to find carelessly hidden objects, to see that pile of old clothes in the corner, to notice the imperfection in the wall that hides the secret door, the trigger for the trap ahead, the ambush. These are the types of things that the GM cannot mention to the players because to do so would call them to special attention that the character's perception might not allow.\n\nIf a character states that he is watching or examining an area, situation, or place, the GM should make a static maneuver roll modifier with the perception skill bonus of the character to determine if the character notices or detects anything. The GM may keep this roll secret, revealing only what the character has observed. Of course, heavy subtractions should be given (if a roll is allowed at all) in situations where the players don't know what their characters are looking for or don't specify that their characters are looking for something in particular (likewise, looking for ceiling traps makes it difficult to see pit traps, etc). The bonus may be used to modify an opponent's maneuver roll attempt to Stalk or Hide. If a character states that he/she is looking for a specific thing, then he/she gains a +30 to perceive it, but a -30 to perceive anything else.\n\n**Option 1:** If the GM feels that the General Perception skill is too all-encompassing and potent, a highly viable option is to break down the General Perception skill into seven sensing categories:\n\n - Balance: This is your sense of physical equilibrium.\n - Body: This is the sense of knowing where one portion of the body is in relation to the rest. Those who have been stopped by the City Guards for RUI/RWI (Riding Under the Influence / Riding While Intoxicated) have experienced the testing of it. RUI/RWI is a nasty rap.\n - Hearing: Self-explanatory\n - Sight: Self-explanatory\n - Smell: Self-explanatory\n - Taste: Self-explanatory\n - Touch: Self-explanatory\n\nThe character may develop the skill ranks of any two senses with one development cost. Each additional sense must be developed individually. This option can be extremely playable and plausible (standard perception skill is an awful lot of sense enhancement bought at bargain basement prices).\n\n**Option 2:** As Option 1 above, except also allow a General Perception skill to be developed, with a basic -30 to perception rolls.

            Rolemaster is created for a world with a variety of cultures and languages. There is no such thing as a common tongue or an alignment tongue (though a GM can add them for his world system), although certain professions have developed their own languages for use in research. Each language must be developed individually in steps from a rank at which the language cannot even be recognized to a rank of full understanding of the idiom and inference.\n\n**Linguistic Addendum:** There are numerous languages already available for a GM to choose from for his world scheme, and most are already in place in a well-designed world. Here we would like to set forth the general types of languages for GM consideration. In a complex and multi-faceted world these do deserve some attention.\n\n• **Racial Languages:** These are the languages generally used and recognized by the individual races. For example, Elven and Dwarvish.\n• **Cultural Languages:** These are the language variations in an area, usually related to some extent to the racial language(s). For example, Easterner and Westron.\n• **Social Languages:** These are the language variations in a particular culture. For example, High Speech is used by the nobility in Eria, Common Erian is spoken by most others, while Street Talk is used by the lower classes. It is up to the individual GM to determine whether any such variants exist and what their similarity to each other is (e.g., knowing Erian High Speech allows 1/2 skill rank in Common Erian and 1/4 skill rank in Street Talk).\n• **Professional Languages:** These are the special languages spoken by a particular profession, and need not be related to any spoken language. For example, Sword Tongue is spoken by the members of the Brotherhood of the Blade and is a special manufactured language used for recognition and secrecy by the higher echelons. Old Landalian is spoken by the members of the Elcaluva College (spell users) for the same reasons plus the fact that it is the now dead language that many of the ancient Magi used (and wrote their texts in). The Thieve's Guild uses a hyper-slang language known as Thieve's Cant, for recognition, secrecy, and safety. Thieve's Cant can be spoken at 1/4 skill rank by the local populace.\n• **Religious Languages:** These languages are the special languages spoken by the various religious orders, for reasons of tradition, ceremony, and recognition. They may or may not be related to any other spoken language. For example, the Priests of Kanorak speak Kanorakki in High Ceremony and for recognition (a god-given language for the followers of the True Faith), and Old Nakrin, an ancient form of the current language which can be spoken by laymembers at 1/2 skill rank. Druid Tongue, however, has been preserved unchanged for untold eons and while spoken by the Inner Circle of Druidry, is now too far removed from current languages to be considered related.\n• **Magical Languages:** These languages are rarely used except in conjunction with spell casting, where they aid the spell's potency. Added to the list of Magical Languages is Elya, First Speech, the tongue of power which creates. It is the language of Power Words.

        type: "Maneuver",
        description: `
            This is one of the skill areas that does not conform to the general skill bonus pattern. Each Armor Type has a maneuver penalty associated with it for untrained individuals. This penalty modifies Moving Maneuver rolls. The different armor types are divided into five groups based on composition types: types 1-4 = No armor; types 5-8 = Soft Leather; types 9-12 = Rigid Leather; types 13-16 = Chain; and types 17-20 = Plate. A character may develop maneuvering skill for each of these groups.
            Each skill rank of maneuvering for a group of armor types reduces the penalty for maneuver by 5 even (even for skill ranks over 10) until the minimum maneuver penalty is reached. This limit represents the fact that the weight and constriction of the armor will always hinder the character to some extent. These minimums may vary for certain superior or magical armor.\n\n**Example:** Dral has a skill rank 18 in Maneuvering in Plate Armor. He may wear breastplate and greaves (AT 18) with a maneuver penalty of only 20 = 110 - (18 x 5). If he wears just the breastplate (AT 17), the penalty is 15 even though 90 - (18 x 5) = 0; since 15 is the minimum maneuver penalty associated with wearing a breastplate.\n\n**Notes on the Advantages of Armor Types:** Armor types are designed to reflect the protective capability of one's covering. Heavier coverings (e.g., AT's 15, 16, 19, 20, etc.) are usually much more cumbersome than light armor or mere clothing. It is easier to make contact with, but it resists penetration better than the less cumbersome armor types. Therefore, "critical strikes" achieved against the more cumbersome armor types will be less frequent and lower in severity. However, attacks resulting in just concussion hits will be more frequent (e.g., the hindrance due to these coverings makes the target easier to strike but harder to seriously damage).\n\nLess cumbersome armor types have the advantage of providing the wearer with mobility. Fewer swings will make contact because the agile defender will completely avoid the blows. However, when a swing does make contact, the result is usually more severe than it would be against the more cumbersome armor types: frequent and severe criticals along with more concussion hits are the rule.\n\nAnimals often attack the upper body. In addition, their penetrating power is usually limited. This is reflected in the Claw Law attack tables. Animals and monsters can be devastating against the lighter armor types where the wearer's high mobility is outweighed by the creature's superior maneuverability. However, against higher armor types, most beast attacks are relatively ineffective.\n\nSpell attacks are also affected by armor. Metal armor is particularly effective when a character is resisting spells, but often lessens the wearer's mobility. Therefore, he may be easier to hit with Elemental spells but harder to severely damage. Lightning, and other forms of electrical attacks, are more effective against metal-clad foes. Fire is more effective against flammable armor types; primarily the organic armor types (e.g., leather and cloth).

MA Ranks represent the complexity and effectiveness of the different MA attacks. Rank 1 is the simplest (and least effective), while Rank 4 is the most complex (and the deadliest). The skills are further classified according to "type" as being "striking" (Karate-like MA, including boxing) or "Sweeps & Throws" (Judo-like MA, including wrestling).\n\n**Effect on Martial Arts Skill:** The skill rank bonus for a particular MA Rank is part of the Offensive Bonus used when a MA attack is made utilizing that MA Rank. Normally, a character may choose which MA Rank he wishes to use in an attack.\n\n**Effect on MA Type and Rank:** Only one MA Rank and type may be used to attack in a given round. If Claw Law is being used, the MA Rank determines the maximum possible result that an attack can obtain, while the MA type (striking or sweeps & throws) determines which attack table is used. 11.72 Summary of Martial Arts Combat Capabilities Table, Claw Law, is NOT used with characters developed using Character Law.\n\n**Limitations on MA Skill Development:** Skill in MA Rank cannot be developed to a skill rank higher than the existing skill ranks of the lower MA Ranks of the same type (e.g., either striking or sweeps & throws). In other words, MA Striking Rank 4 can never have a higher skill rank than MA Striking Rank 3, MA Striking Rank 3 can never have a higher skill rank than MA Striking Rank 2, and MA Striking Rank 2 can never have a higher skill rank than MA Striking Rank 1. Likewise for the Sweeps & Throws.

            The power projection skill has a variety of uses. First, it can be used to recharge special power-storing magic items, and to withdraw power from such a device. It can also be used for what is known as matching power. In matching power, two spell-users face one another at a distance of about 10'. Each makes a Power Projection roll, and if successful, begins projecting raw magical energy towards one another. When the two streams of power collide, the circuit is complete, and the circuit begins to glow (at the point of collision) and the spell users begin to feel the resistance. Each one can "up the ante" by raising the level of power. Each round a power projection roll must be made to ensure that the spell user is successful. At any point the power levels on matching can be lowered back down. If a spell user in a contest of matching power cannot meet the "ante", his side collapses and all projected power points feed back through him, giving him 1 point of damage/power point of feedback. This cannot be used in an offensive manner because it requires two opposing spell users to complete the circuit.

            Rune skill enables a character to decipher and use Runes (spells inscribed in suitable media). To decipher a Rune a character makes an open-ended roll, adds his skill rank bonus, adds any bonuses from 15.34 Runes and Staves/Wands Table, ChL&CaL, pg 40, and subtracts the level of the spell on the Rune. If the resulting total is 101+ then the Rune is deciphered and the character may use it. If the total is negative, the spell on the Rune is cast on the character attempting to decipher the Rune (or a random bystander if the GM deems it appropriate). If the total is between 75 and 100, the character learns what the spell is but cannot use it. If the total is between 0 and 74 then nothing happens. These results are summarized in 15.34 Runes and Staves/Wands Table, ChL&CaL, pg 40.\n\nIf the level of the spell on the Rune is less than or equal to the level of the character attempting to use it to cast a spell, deciphering the Rune is sufficient to use it (subject to the normal chances of Spell Failure). If the Rune is a level above the character, or of a realm of magic other than his specialty, a second roll, similar to the first, must be made to successfully cast the spell from the Rune (for these purposes, Fighters, Thieves, Rogues, Traders, High Warrior Monks, Barbarians, Dancers, Scholars, Burglars, and Warrior Monks have no realm of magic that is their specialty and so must always make a second roll). Runes are generally not reusable, but the rune paper is.\n\nA character should be given one chance to decipher a Rune. If he fails, he may not try again until he improves his skill rank with Runes. Generally, this is accomplished by going up a level, but if the character has not planned on increasing his Rune skill rank (has not allocated any development points to it), he does not get to make another try at deciphering it until his Rune skill rank is increased.

        description: `
            This skill determines when a spell list is learned (e.g., when spells on that list may be cast). Each spell list skill rank gives a 5% chance of "learning" a chosen spell list; thus when a rank of 20 is obtained, there is a 100% chance of learning the list (i.e., automatic). Spell list skill rank may only be developed for one spell list at a time.\n\nIf at the end of a development period (adolescence, apprenticeship, or when a new level is reached) a character has a spell list rank between 1 and 20, a roll should be made to see if the spell list is learned. If the sum of the roll and the spell list skill rank multiplied by 5 is greater than 100, the spell list is learned. If the spell list is not learned the skill rank remains the same. When a list is learned, the spell list skill rank is reduced to zero (0). If a skill rank of 20 is obtained during a development period, the spell list is immediately learned (with the spell list skill rank being reduced to zero (0)) and the character may develop the spell list skill rank for another spell list in order to obtain a chance of learning a second list (once again a 5% chance per rank).This paragraph is described in greater detail in the following paragraphs\n\nThis area diverges from the stansdard skill and bonus rule. In **Character Law**, a character who is trying to learn spells makes a Spell Gain Roll upon reaching each new experience level. This is a 1-100 roll (not open-ended) with a roll of 101+ required for success. An add is allowed for the amount of research the character has done in that particular area (list) of magic, as measured by the number of development levels he has committed to it.\n\nAll spells in Spell Law are grouped into "lists" of spells of similar conception and effect. When a character expends development points to acquire skills, he may attempt to study one "List" of spells. Each time he expends the development points required for spell acquisition (usually 1/* for a pure spell user, *for a semi-spell user, and 20, 10, 8 for non-spell user), he indicates what "List" he is attempting to learn and records one research point for that "List". A Pure, Hybrid, or Semi-spell user may acquire several research points for a "List" at one time. These research points represent the amount of the character's development devoted to discovering the basic concepts involved in the use of those spells, through reading, meditation, etc. The GM must be the judge of the availability and cost of the information to the character (suggested requirements are given in 13.52 Additional Requirements For Skill Acquisition, ChL&CaL, pg 62). In this sense, a research point can be thought of as a temporary "skill rank" for a specific spell list.\n\n1. When making a Spell Gain Roll, the character adds his accumulated research points multiplied by 5 to his roll (1-100, not open-ended). Thus 20 research points guarantee that the character will learn his spell list. If the roll is not successful, the accumulated research is not lost; rather, it just means that the character has not drawn the proper conclusions and inferences from what he has learned. After he has had time to reconsider what he knows and has gained further experience in the ways of the world and magic (i.e., the next time he reaches a higher level) he may make another Spell Gain Roll, gaining the full benefit of his accumulated research points (which he may increase by further development). Eventually, the character will acquire the use of those spells (assuming he survives and continues to go up levels).\n2. Once a successful Spell Gain Roll is made, the character is considered to have learned the spells he was researching and may cast them as long as such use complies with other rules for their use. The number of research points has no further affect on the game. It matters not how much effort the character put into learning the spells from this point onward; a character who used two spell research points to learn a "List" can cast spells from it as well as someone who used 20. Note that when using Spell Law, "Lists" of magic are divided at various levels and further research must be done on a list to learn it above each break point. Although the lower portion of a spell list is a prerequisite, research points used to acquire the lower portion of a list have no effect on attempts to acquire the higher spells on that list.\n3. Partial research may only be done into one list at one time. Characters may not partially study a variety of lists and count on the gods of luck to give them spell abilities. A character must study only one spell list at a time (except as noted below).\n4. If a character is able to allocate enough points to bring his research point total to 20 (ensuring the learning of the spell list at the next level of experience), he learns the first level spell on that list (if any) immediately (before reaching the next level of experience) and may begin working on learning another spell list. When he attains the next level of experience, he will acquire the normal use of the first list and be entitled to make a Spell Gain Roll for the second. In extreme cases, this same process may result in learning three spell lists in one level.\n\nIf a character, after making an unsuccessful Spell Gain Roll, wishes to begin the study of another list, he may do so, but he forfeits all research points accumulated with the first spell list. Such points may neither be transferred nor retained. If enough development points are allocated to bring the research point total with the first list to 20, the character may then begin to study the second as described above.

            Related stats are based on the realm of power from which the spell is derived. Bonus for spells which require rolls for concentration, maneuvers, or orientation. This skill allows the user to modify spells beyond basic parameters. Each individual spell requires separate skill development (as with Riding or Weapon skills). A GM may establish "similar" spell groups. For example, a Magician could use the Targeting skill to control a tricky Teleport spell within the normal spell parameters, but if he had Spell Mastery, he could attempt to modify the spell way outside normal parameters, perhaps teleporting more than the normally allowed mass.\n\n**Option 1:** This option is only used if the Targeting skill is used. Since the Targeting skill enhances spell control within the stated spell parameters, use the Spell Mastery skill to allow a character to attempt to enhance and modify a particular spell beyond normal spell parameters. For example, a Magician could use the Targeting to control a tricky Teleport spell within the normal spell parameters, but if he had Spell Mastery he could attempt to modify the spell way outside normal parameters, perhaps only teleporting more than the normally allowed mass.\n\nIf a Spell Mastery skill roll is unsuccessful, the spell involved falls under ESF rules. The ESF mod in this case is the amount by which the Spell Mastery skill roll failed multiplied by the maneuver difficulty (Medium: x1; Hard: x2; etc.). \n\nESF mod = (amount of failure) x (difficulty multiplier).\n\n**Example:** Rae Dur Sommette is attempting to spell master a Shock Bolt into a "Shock Ball 10' R". The GM assigns -50 and a difficulty of 'very hard'. His total skill roll bonus is 94. He fails by just 7 points (he had to break 100). Rae Dur's ESF mod is 21 = 7 x 3. Rae Dur must roll over 21 or be subject to ESF spell failure in addition to Spell Mastery failure.\n\n**Option 2:** The GM may decide that the spell caster must concentrate for a spell modified by Spell Mastery to have an effect. If the concentration is broken or dropped, the spell ceases to operate as modified and reverts back to normal spell operation. For example, the spell Waterwall True is a non-mobile spell, and the caster decides to use Spell Mastery to try to make the waterwall moveable at a rate of up to 10'/md. The GM informs the mage that a Spell Mastery skill roll will be required and that he will have to maintain concentration on the spell to make it moveable. If concentration is broken or dropped, the waterwall reverts back to a normal, immobile waterwall.

With this option, each skill rank will confer a +5/level for the first 10 skill ranks, a +2/level for the next 10 skill ranks, etc.

A "subdual" attack roll of 101+ results in a successful attack, although the victim still receives a RR versus an attack level equal to the Subduing skill rank used. Unarmed, the character must approach the foe undetected and be able to strike before the latter can react. Should the foe be engaged in melee, the subduer's skill bonus is halved. Subduing attacks cannot be made against foes whose armor covers the entirety of their body above the legs (e.g., AT's 11, 12, 15, 16, 19, and 20).

            Skill is used in two weapon combinations. With this skill, the user may engage in two-weapon combat without the -20 modifier. He gains 2 attacks each round and may engage two opponents, provided neither opponent is receiving any positional combat modifiers for their OB (e.g., If either opponent is receiving +15 for Flank Attack or +20 for Rear Attack, the individual cannot attack both opponents in the same round).\n**Against 1 opponent:** There is no negative attack mod.\n**Against 2 opponents:** There is a -20 to both attacks.\n**Parrying:** The user must reduce both weapon OB's by the same amount. Against 1 opponent, the user gains the parrying effect of 1 weapon. Against 2 opponents, each opponent may be parried against equally.\n**Similar Skill:** This skill only allows similar weapon skill for other two-weapon combinations utilizing the same type of weapons.\n**Development Cost:** The basic cost is equal to the cost of learning both weapons (e.g., Garrot Felheart, the Fighter, wants to learn two weapon combo in his two favorite weapons, the morning star and the mace. Each normally has a cost of 1/5, so his development cost for two weapon combo (morning star and mace) is 2/10. The two weapon combo is learned for a particular hand. For example, in Garrot's case, he learns the morning star in the right hand and the mace in the left hand. If Garrot wishes to be able to switch weapons in his hands and suffer no negative mods then he must learn two weapon combo, morning star (right hand) and mace (left hand) and then learn morning star (left hand) and mace (right hand).\n**Penalty for using two weapon combo with only 1 weapon:** Using only one weapon instead of both weapons puts the skill user at a -25 for any attacks made with the single weapon unless he has already developed skill using the weapon single-handed (e.g., Garrot got caught napping and only managed to get his hands on his morning star. Using the morning star which he has developed as part of his two weapon combo, his OB is reduced by -25. However, he could have gotten his mace out (which he has also developed singularly) and he would not have been penalized -25).\n**Using two weapon combo with 2-handed weapons:** There are two options for handling two weapon combo with one or both of the weapons being of the 2-handed variety.\n - **Option 1:** The GM may not allow 2-handed weapons to be used in two weapon combo.\n - **Option 2:** To use one 2-handed weapon or two 2-handed weapons in two weapon combo, the user must have a strength bonus mod of +30 or +60 respectively. If the individual does not have the necessary strength, then the GM may not allow 2-handed weapons to be used in two weapon combo.\n - **Option 3:** As in Option 2, except that attempting to use the 2-handed weapon without a sufficient strength mod places a negative OB modifier to both of the weapons. The negative OB modifier is the difference between the required strength and the individual's strength mod times two (2). For example, Dactonic has developed a two weapon combo (great sword in right hand and long sword in left hand). Dactonic's strength mod is only +25, and so using a two weapon combo with the greatsword gives him a -10 = [(30-25) x -2] to his OB. However, if he used two greatswords, he would be at -70 = [(60-25) x -2].

            These skills determine a character's effectiveness when using weapons in combat (as opposed to spells). Skill must be developed separately for each weapon. The skill bonus for each weapon is part of the character's Offensive Bonus with that weapon. The total Offensive Bonus (includes a number of factors) is usually added to any attack rolls made with that weapon.\n\nSix skill costs for weapons are listed on the Character Development Table. The following six categories of weapons must be assigned to these costs:\n - One-Handed Edge Weapons\n - One-Handed Crushing Weapons\n - Two-Handed Weapons\n - Bows\n - Thrown Weapons\n - Pole Arms\n\nSome weapons fit into more than one category—a hand axe can be held in hand or thrown, and skills should be developed with both methods of using it separately. Similarly, some weapons may be used either one-handed or two-handed, and skill must be developed separately for each mode of use.\n\nDuring the adolescent period, characters will develop an interest or an affinity with a weapon (and category), making skill in that type of weapon easier to develop. Thus each character may take the six weapon skill costs listed for his profession and assign them to the six weapon categories as he sees fit. A Fighter, for example, may have two weapon categories in which it is easy to develop weapon skill (costs: 1/5 and 2/5), one category which is very difficult (cost 5), and the other categories range in between (costs: 2/7). Once assigned, these skill costs are permanent, they may not be switched around later.\n\nThe GM may decide that the culture in which the character grew up will determine some of a character's categories/cost assignments\n\n**Example:** Dral grew up in a country where bows were considered undignified and beneath true warriors, and so the GM decides that Oral (a Fighter) must put his cost "5" in the bow column, in spite of the fact that the player controlling Oral would rather shoot people in the back from long range than risk death in a fair sword fight.\n\nA character's skill with each weapon (and each way of using it) is considered a separate area for development purposes. Thus, Drat's skill with a crossbow has no effect on his use of a composite bow although both are in the same weapons category. Similarly, skill with a scimitar does not help you with a longsword: although both weapons are similar, there are serious problems with trying to use them in the same way. (See the ChL&CaL optional rules, 13.11, for some suggestions on the effects of learning weapon skills similar to those already acquired.)\n\nNote that because different weapons are considered separate, two weapons of the same type may be developed simultaneously without penalty, provided that the development cost of each is paid.\n\nUse Agility stat bonus for bows, and Strength stat bonus for other weapons.

The xeno-lore cost development is added to the cost of the extra-dimensional skill being learned.\n\n**Example:** Basic Mathematics cost 2/6 for the No Profession and if attempting to learn Xeno-Lore, Basic Mathematics the cost would be 2/6+6. Due to the fact that the No Profession has only cost development for 1 skill rank per level he can only learn one skill rank of Xeno-lore basic mathematics and the development cost would be 8 = 2 + 6.\n\nA Bard wishes to learn the racial history of a xeno-lore based being. Normally the cost would be 1/6 but the xeno-lore cost development is 3/5, so the cost development would be 4/11 (1+3=4 and 6+5=11).\n\nIf the skill cost is 2/* then treat this as a skill cost of 2/2 for the purposes of learning xeno based skills.

For example, using the No Profession in the above example the cost for learning xeno based mathematics would be 4/12 (doubled) or 6/18 (tripled).
